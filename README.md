# Birthday Website Starter üéÇ

A super-simple, innovative starter for a birthday wish website using **HTML + CSS + JavaScript**. Includes:
- Typing effect for your message
- Confetti burst on click
- Floating hearts that follow the mouse
- Optional background music (your MP3)

## 1) Set up VS Code
1. Download & install **Visual Studio Code**: https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Open VS Code, go to **Extensions** (left sidebar icon).
3. Install **Live Server** (by Ritwick Dey).

## 2) Get the project on your computer
1. Unzip this folder anywhere (e.g., Desktop).
2. In VS Code, click **File ‚Üí Open Folder...** and select the unzipped `birthday-site-starter` folder.

## 3) Run the site locally
- Right-click `index.html` in the Explorer and choose **Open with Live Server**.
- Your browser will open `http://127.0.0.1:5500` (or similar) and auto-refresh on saves.

> Tip: If you don't want to use Live Server, you can also double-click `index.html` to open it,
> but some features work best with Live Server.

## 4) Personalize it
- Open `index.html` and change the name inside `<span id="name">My Love</span>`.
- Change the message in `<p id="typing" data-text="..."></p>`.
- Put your photos inside `assets/images/` and your MP3 in `assets/audio/song.mp3` (rename it to `song.mp3`).
- Colors & animations live in `style.css`.
- Interactive effects live in `script.js`.

## 5) Optional: Publish it (free)
**GitHub Pages** (no server needed):
1. Create a GitHub account (if you don't have one) and a new repository.
2. Upload everything from this folder to the repo root.
3. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Pages**, under *Build and deployment* select **Deploy from a branch**, then choose the `main` branch and `/ (root)`.
4. Wait a minute. Your site will be live at: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

**Netlify (drag & drop):**
1. Sign up at https://www.netlify.com/
2. Drag the entire folder into the *Deploys* area. Done.

## 6) Next steps (ideas)
- Add a timeline of memories (create a new section).
- Add a button to reveal a heartfelt letter.
- Add a photo gallery carousel.
- Let friends leave wishes (requires a small backend or a form service).

Enjoy and happy birthday to your special person! ‚ù§Ô∏è
